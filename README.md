Task Overview

You are working on a SaaS product where the FastAPI backend is containerized using Docker. The frontend client cannot access the backend API due to CORS policy errors; specifically, the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is missing from responses. Your task is to identify and resolve the CORS issue in the FastAPI application and ensure the backend is properly configured for browser-based access during development.

Guidance
- Focus on diagnosing the root cause of missing CORS headers in API responses.
- Consider best practices for enabling CORS in FastAPI apps running inside Docker containers.
- Ensure your approach remains secure and does not expose unnecessary origins in production settings.
- Make sure your configuration works for both browser and command-line HTTP clients.
- The fix must persist when running the backend in Docker using the provided configuration.

Objectives
- Update the FastAPI application so that it includes appropriate CORS headers on API responses.
- Ensure the solution allows the frontend web client (running on a different origin) to communicate with the API without CORS errors.
- The backend must remain functional and accessible in its Dockerized setup.
- Apply FastAPI best practices for enabling CORS in a deployment scenario.

How to Verify
- After applying your solution and starting the backend in Docker, make HTTP requests from a browser or a JavaScript client to an API endpoint and ensure there are no CORS errors in the browser's console.
- Check that responses from the API endpoints include the correct 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header matching the expected origin.
- Confirm the backend remains accessible and operational from permitted clients such as curl or Postman as well as from your frontend environment.
